analyzing same-different task

when calculating pitch difference, use the two frequency (Hz) columns rather than the final column. (Final column incorrectly exceeds 12 semitones for many subjects; also, "same" trials will show a false pitch difference anyway. Also, for the first set of subjects, the final column starts at 10 rather than 7 -- would require a shift down)
